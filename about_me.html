        About Me:
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Nick. I am from Huntington Beach, California, and would like to introduce myself as a computer science major who has high hopes in having a career in coding someday. First of all, I'd like to say that I was born in the end of May, and it falls normally on memorial day. The really bad thing about this is that no one was available to go to my birthdays as a child because they were always going on trips to places on my birthdays. No worries though, I have the indoors to myself, so I would play with puzzles and stuff in my free time, which eventually evolved to computer puzzles, and then I learned about coding. As a kid, I thought anyone that could hack and code were badasses and that they would rule the future(which they kinda do).<BR><BR>This brought me to believe that if I became what I admired so much as a kid, I could become something great one day that people would fear.(I was a little crazy huh) But, no I don’t wanna hurt anyone.I also loved playing video games as a kid, and I’d love to play them with my childhood friend. The best part of my childhood friend and mine is that we have birthdays that are 2 days apart from each other, and we were neighbors. Once he moved away, most of our conversations came through the form of video games, which ended up starting an obsession with video games. To get me away from my video games, my parents as a kid wanted me to go outside and play more often. ended up taking up sports as my parents wanted me to, and I ended up playing baseball for most of my life. I grew up normally, although I was the quiet kid. Who would have thought, I know right. Anyways, I hated talking in front of crowds and introducing myself in general. This mentality kept me shy for the most part, which in turn helped me get no friends.<BR><BR>I eventually grew out of my little shell in high school, while playing baseball and talking to other people. High school was a new experience for me at the time because it was my first public school experience. Public school was weird in many ways for me because all my expectations of what it would be like, were flipped on its head. I thought some specific people would get bullied and some people would rule high school, but it ended up the complete opposite, me included. I thought I would make it out of high school while making sure that I don’t end up putting myself in a bad position, but that didn’t happen. Oh well, there’s only so much that you could prevent. I ended up making friends when someone lent me a hand and asked if I wanted to join their group of friends. From then on, I still have those friends, and they will always be some of my closest friends to this day. My life in college now is good, although very stressful at points, has been a wonderful time, nonetheless.
